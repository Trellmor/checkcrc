checkcrc is a programm to compare crc32 checksum. Files coming from irc
bots will often be named like "somename_[DEADBEEF].avi", where DEADBEEF
is the crc32 checksum. checkcrc will try to find checksum strings in
filenames and will compare them to the files checksum.

checkcrc can also be used to create checksums of files by using the -c
swtich.

Usage: checkcrc [-cvh] [file ...]
 
    -c  Only calculate checksums, don't try to find a checksum string to compare
    -v  Display version number
    -g  Display this help

	file can by any number of files you want to check.

	
For instructions how to compile and install checkcrc see INSTALL.
